E-commerce Sales Dashboard
Welcome to our e-commerce sales dashboard repository on GitHub! This interactive dashboard is designed to help online store owners gain insights into their sales performance.

Tableau Dashboard
The dashboard is built using Tableau, a powerful data visualization tool that enables users to interact with the data and uncover hidden insights. It is comprised of several key metrics, including sales by region, product category, and time period. Users can use filters to drill down into specific data points, such as sales by individual product, customer segment, or marketing channel.

The sales map provides a visual representation of sales by geographic region, giving users a quick overview of their sales performance across different locations. The product category chart allows users to compare sales across different product categories, helping them identify which categories are driving their sales.

The time series chart displays sales data over a specific time period, allowing users to track changes in sales over time and identify trends. The dashboard also includes a table that provides a detailed breakdown of sales data by product, customer segment, or marketing channel.
